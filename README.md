# bigbigint
A simple class to support multi-byte integers

The main portion of the code is in the bigbigint.cpp file and header.  Initially, this code was as a testbed for finding very large prime numbers.  While I gave up on the prime number project, this code still lives as an independent class.

I've uploaded it here for historical purposes (personal archive) and in case others want to take a look.

Enjoy.
